	* src/Makefile.am: Added sfnlfn.dat to EXTRA_DIST.

	* src/sfnlfn.dat: new file mapping short file names to long file
	names for files in the src directory. Used by the short-file-names
	and long-file-names make targets.

	src/realtime.c, src/res-access.c, src/resource.c: Unused attribute
	moved after inclusion of config.h to improve portability.  Added
	alternate include file names for short file name systems.
	
	* src/iopl.c, src/pnp-select.c: Unused attribute moved after
	inclusion of config.h to improve portability.

	* src/release.c: added config.h.

	* src/isapnp.c, src/isapnp_main.l, src/mysnprtf.c, src/pnpdump.c,
	src/pnpdump_main.c: Added alternate include file names for short
	file name systems.

	* include/isapnp/Makefile.am: Added sfnlfn.dat to EXTRA_DIST.
	
	* include/isapnp/sfnlfn.dat: new file mapping short file names to
	long file names for files in the include/isapnp directory. Used by
	the short-file-names and long-file-names make targets.

	* include/isapnp/iopl.h: Don't include inlines/pc.h for borland
	compilers.

	* include/isapnp/callbacks.h, include/isapnp/res-access.h: Added

	* configure.in: Update for 1.26.  Test for pnpdump.c which doesn't
	change it's name.  Add --enable-sfn to allow compilation when
	files have been renamed with short file names.  Add
	--enable-static to allow compiling static binaries.

	* acconfig.h: Add HAVE_SFN for --enable-sfn option. Add include
	for config.bor with Borland compilers.

	* Makefile.am: Add makeDOSr.bat to EXTRA_DIST.  Add targets

1.24 -> 1.25
	* src/iopl.c: portability improvement - wrap include unistd.h

	* src/isapnp_main.l: portability improvements - wrap include
	unistd.h, (SetIOBaseReg, SetIOSize): use longs instead of
	ints. (isapnp_main): Fix segmentation violation with -t

	number of arguments provided.

	* src/pnpdump_main.c: (large): char array removed. (pnpdump_main):
	Fix segmentation violation with -t option. (lengtherror):
	rewritten to print data from resource struct. (printresource):
	Changes to call new version of lengtherror().

	* src/release.c: rewritten to include most of what was in release.h.

	* src/res-access.c: (read_one_resource): initialise res->data if
	len == 0. Fix off by one error when building progress report
	string.

	variable interrupt_num.

	* include/isapnp/pnp.h: Add DEBUG stuff for djgpp.

	* include/isapnp/release.h: Contents moved to release.c, simply
	declare the char arrays containing release information.

	* include/isapnp/Makefile.am: rewritten - greatly simplified.

	* doc/isapnpfaq.sgml: stuff added, see NEWS.

	* doc/README.DOS: Added pointer to README.borland.

	* doc/Makefile.am: Added README.borland to READMES, added

	* src/pnpdump_main.c: (pnpdump_main): Local copy of getopt_long used
	if not supported in system library, Fixed -s and -o options when
	the relevant code is not compiled in. (o_file): Really have fixed
	initialisation for glibc (wasn't in 1.23)

	* src/isapnp_main.l: %option used to make scanner case insensitive and
	get rid of compiler warnings. (isapnp_main): Local copy of
	getopt_long used if not supported in system library. (yywrap): removed.
