Regression Test Plan for pnpdump
--------------------------------
Document version ID:  $Header: /home/omer/work/cvs_repository/capital/isapnptools/test/testplan.txt,v 1.2 1999/11/07 12:20:41 omer Exp $

1. Hardware and operating system/distribution:
   - computer with 0 ISA PnP cards
   - computer with 1 ISA PnP card
   - computer with two ISA PnP cards
   The cards to be used should cover the following resources:
       IRQ
       I/O ports
       DMA
       Memory
       Exactly one + More than one logical card per physical card
   - computer with one or more cards, such that one of them yields
     bad checksum value (to test --ignorecsum).

   - Exercise using both 2.0.x (2.0.36) and 2.2.x kernels (this will
     cover the effect of different formats of /proc "files").

   We'll not exercise under DOS/DJGPP or under OS/2.
   We'll exercise only one __GLIBC__ setting (undefined / 1 / >=2).
   We'll not exercise under undefined REALTIME or with nonstandard
	 settings of NEEDSETSCHEDULER,NEEDNANOSLEEP.

2. Different parameters of the pnpdump command line:
   readport - missing
              < 0x203
              > 0x3FF
              larger than the actual readport used by default
       (We'll NOT check decimal values processing)
   devs - same as # of cards found by the BIOS
          less than the above
          more than the above
              ALSO:
          readport used by the BIOS
          different readport setting

   -c, --config, no option
   -d, --dumpregs, no option
   -D, --debug-isolate, no option
   -i, --ignorecsum, no option
   -r, --reset, no option
       --masks, no option
   -t, --max-realtime
         - no option
         - value of 1 second
         - value of 0 (infinite)
   -s, --script
         - none
         - to stdout (NO!  Runs automatically the shell script!)
         - to a file
   -v, --version

3. Different contents of isapnp.gone
   IO (default size, size=8, size > 8)
   IRQ n
   DMA n
   MEM base,size

   For IRQ and DMA, exercise:
    - none
    - resource which is already mentioned in a /proc "file"
    - resource not used by ISA PnP cards
    - resource used by an ISA PnP card
    - all resources used by an ISA PnP card (make it hungry)

   For IO:
    - none
    - one range not used by ISA PnP cards
    - one range already marked as used in a /proc "file"
    - one range used by a card
    - all ranges used by a card

   For MEM:
    - none
    - one range not used by ISA PnP cards
    - one range used by a card
    - all ranges used by a card

4. Output to be captured:
    - stdout
    - stderr
    - sometimes, a --script=filename

CONSTRUCTION AND USE OF TEST CASES
----------------------------------
Each test case will be a single file divided into the following
sections:
1. pnpdump command line arguments
2. isapnp.gone contents to be used

A reference version of pnpdump (pnpdump-1.19) will be available
for comparing its results to those of the pnpdump build being tested.
