        libisapnp Version 1.21
        ======================

This document covers instructions for usage of the additions made
for version 1.21 of the isapnptools package.

1) To play with the demo programs, first build them by:

   make demo
   make demo2

   Then become superuser, and run them as follows:
   ./demo --scan | more
   ./demo2

   The demo programs are not automatically built when pnpdump and
   isapnp are built.

2) When building a new version of pnpdump, you may verify its output
   against the output of a previous version of pnpdump as follows.
   If you are in the isapnptools directory:
   Become superuser, then

   cd test
   ls t*.dat | ./run_tests.pl /sbin/pnpdump | more

   And inspect the output.  All tests should pass except for tests
   17 and 18.  Those tests should fail because, and only because,
   of difference in the version string.

   The above assumes that the reference version, against which you
   are comparing the newly-built version of pnpdump, exists as
   /sbin/pnpdump.

3) All libisapnp procedures, intended for access by your programs, are
   declared and documented in the header file pnp-access.h

4) COPYRIGHT NOTE:
   I would like to have the library released under the LGPL.
   However, at present, the library uses some code, which was GPLed.
   So for the time being, the library and its source code files are
   all available only under the more-strict GPL.
